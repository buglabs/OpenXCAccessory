# --- For trace recording information
# Vehicle data stream trace recording snapshot duration (in seconds)
# openxc_vi_trace_snapshot_duration 10

# Idle duration between subsequent Vehicle data trace recording snapshot (in seconds)
# openxc_vi_trace_idle_duration 0

# Vehicle data trace snapshot truncate size (in bytes - 0 means NO truncate by default)
