The OpenXC Accessories are a line of hardware accessories intended to augment the Vehicle Interface (VI) and communicate with other entities. The benefit of the Accessory Platform is that all accessories share a common base (or motherboard) and new features are added by modifying or designing a new daughter card (mPCIe connector).

The base board contains an Atmel SAMA5 (Cortex-A5) running embedded Linux. All accessory functions are coded in Python. Interfaces include SD card slot, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Low Energy (a.k.a Bluetooth Smart), USB OTG. WiFi is currently being enabled. A debug serial port is available.

The first in the line of accessories is a 3G Modem to enable sharing of vehicle data directly with the cloud, OTA updates to the Modem configuration, and still allows use of the Enabler app.
